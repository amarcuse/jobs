# Moven's History and Background

Moven was founded in 2011 as a US direct-to-consumer pre-paid card program designed to deliver and inspire ‘financial wellness’ through a digital-first approach by Brett King, a futurist by nature and technician by trade. He is an Amazon bestselling author, award-winning speaker, and radio show host of ‘Breaking Banks’. His commercial market thesis is centered around how technology is and should disrupt legacy financial institution business models and capture more value from behavioral and transactional data. Further using this better data to establish or enhance a truly ‘personalized’ banking experience.

## What we do today

Moven was relaunched in late 2016 with our first commercial Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) contract with TD Bank (Canada). This was followed by a formal global enterprise operation that established our footprint throughout Indonesia, Japan, Saudia Arabia, New Zealand and Latin America.  Moven provides ‘white-label’ financial management technology to fully enable incumbent banks to compete with the rise of challenger banks. These tools represent a set of features, functionalities, and user journeys that support our original thesis of delivering financial wellness to consumers by, with, and through financial institutions.

Recently, Moven was afforded the opportunity to enter the US market which has created our greatest market opportunity yet. We are now exclusively focused on the global SaaS business channel with an emphasis on the US market.

Moven operates as a remote-first, agile organization with strong communication channels and an innovative culture allowing employees to focus on delivering technology solutions to clients in the U.S. and around the globe.
