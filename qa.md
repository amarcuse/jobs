## QA Engineer

**Filled for now**

Want to help disrupt the global banking industry? We are hiring!

Moven is seeking a QA Engineer to help build our next-generation mobile platform, a greenfield project written in React Native, Redux and JavaScript, communicating with a GraphQL API written in TypeScript, all running within containers orchestrated by Kubernetes.

This is a remote position open to candidates worldwide.

## Responsibilities

Ensure both project and production quality of business and technology outcomes, through the creation and execution of manual and automated tests.

* Drive product quality through hands-on creation and execution of tests;
* Coordinate with the development team to document and resolve defects;
* Assist the QA Manager with development of test automation;
* Be a champion for quality within the organization.

As you grow into this role, you’ll make meaningful contributions to our codebase, especially our new mobile platform. You’ll become familiar with all layers of our stack as you grow and execute our test base, squash bugs, and help maintain a squeaky-clean codebase. You’ll also gain a wider understanding of Moven’s business as you interact with our product and sales teams.

## Experience and Skills

To succeed in this role, you’ll need these skills in your toolbox:

* Experience with Total Quality Management and DevOps methods and tools, such as agile/scrum, continuous integration, automated configuration management, test driven development, data center and cloud automation, and UI monitoring and measurement tools;
* 1-2 years of experience in a testing/QA or developer/engineering role in previous company;
* Some working knowledge of modern cloud-deployed technologies, primarily AWS; secondarily Github, Mongo, Compose (MongoHQ), PostGres, and Node.js;
* Strong attention to detail including precise and effective communications and ability to work in an environment with competing priorities;
* Superior verbal and written communications skills;
* B.S. in Computer Science, Total Quality Management, Business Operations Management, MIS, or related field (M.S. preferred).


To excel in this role, you should possess some of the following skills:

* Mobile testing experience is a plus;
* Experience with bank operations in a business process management context is a plus.

Only experienced and passionate candidates with a proven track record of top performance, willingness to work in a flat organizational structure, and desire to disrupt the banking industry should apply. We are basically building an “A-Team” of business technologists who can demonstrate expertise and humbleness for serving our customer and our business… are you capable and willing to join such a team?
