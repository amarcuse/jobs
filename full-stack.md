# Full Stack Engineer

Want to help disrupt the global banking industry? We’re hiring!

Moven is seeking a Full-Stack Software Engineer to help build and maintain our next-generation mobile platform, written in JavaScript, communicating with a GraphQL API written in TypeScript, all running within containers orchestrated by Kubernetes.
This position is remote but, but you must be based in the United States.

## Responsibilities

Within the first few weeks, you’ll learn the ropes by attending our daily stand-up meetings, collaborating with a mentor, and fixing some minor bugs. You’ll learn our Agile development methodology, our Continuous Integration systems, and everything in between. We’re working with some of the latest technology the open source community has to offer, so some ramp-up time is to be expected.

As you grow into this role, you’ll make meaningful contributions to our codebase, especially our new mobile platform. You’ll become familiar with all layers of our stack as you create new features, squash bugs, and help maintain a squeaky-clean codebase. You’ll also gain a wider understanding of Moven’s business as you interact with our product and sales teams.

Once you master this role, you’ll take ownership of multiple projects and help define the future of Moven. You’ll create new software engineering standards, research solutions to our largest  problems, and write awesome code. You’ll also act as a technical leader by frequently and directly interacting with one of our premier customers, conducting code reviews, mentoring junior engineers, and conquering technical debt.

* Experience building mobile apps
* Experience building APIs using Node.js and relational databases
* Exposure to AWS or similar cloud computing platforms

* B.S. in Computer Science, a related field, or equivalent work experience

To excel in this role, you should possess some technical leadership skills:

Want to really knock our socks off? We’re particularly looking for these skills:
