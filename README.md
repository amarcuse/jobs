# Jobs@Moven

## About Us

>  Helping legacy FIs and fintechs deliver unique data-driven insights to better address customers' financial wellness.

Wow, what does that even mean?  I think we just won buzzword bingo.

Seriously: we make banking apps for banks and fintechs (and anyone else who wants one).  Our unique angle is *financial wellness*, which means we try to help you manage your finances *automatically*, without any work on your part.  Emphasis on the ***automatically***: computers should be good for something, right?

## How to Apply

Send your resume to `jobs@moven.com`.  We would love a cover letter, but we hate writing them too, so it's okay to just skip it.  Bonus points for fooling us with ChatGPT.  Job title in the subject, unless you want to be considered for the assistant lab rat position in the toxicology testing department.
