## About Us

>  Helping legacy FIs and fintechs deliver unique data-driven insights to better address customers' financial wellness.

Wow, what does that even mean?  I think we just won buzzword bingo.

Seriously: we make banking apps for banks and fintechs (and anyone else who wants one).  Our unique angle is *financial wellness*, which means we try to help you manage your finances *automatically*, without any work on your part.  Emphasis on the *automatically*: computers should be good for something, right?

## Open Positions

[**Full Stack Engineers**](full-stack.md) - We make mobile apps and a custom backend.  There are several openings and the job description has the details, but we could definitely use at least one person with serious mobile app chops.  Mid- to senior-level.  Remote (worldwide).

[**Support Engineer**](support.md) - We love our customers!  Help us keep them happy! Mid-level.  Remote (US).

[**Infrastructure Engineer**](infra.md) - We are all-in on cloud computing, but it's a lot of work.  Help us build and run it!  Mid-level.  Remote (US).

[**QA Engineer**](qa.md) - We ~write perfect code and don't need QA~ occasionally make mistakes.  Help us keep the egg off our face! Junior to mid-level.  Remote (worldwide).

## How to Apply

Send your resume to `jobs@moven.com`.  We'ed love a cover letter, but we hate writing them too, so it's okay to just skip it.  Job title in the subject, unless you want to be considered for the assistent lab rat position in the toxicology testing department.
